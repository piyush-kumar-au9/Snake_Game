# Snake Game using Python

<p>
### About the Game
**bold**Snake is a game where the player maneuvers a line which grows in length,<br /> 
with the line itself being a primary obstacle. <br /> 
There is no standard version of the game. <br /> 
The concept originated in the 1976 arcade game Blockade, <br /> 
and its simplicity has led to many implementations <br /> 
(some of which have the word snake or worm in the title). <br /> 
After a variant was preloaded on Nokia mobile phones in 1998, <br /> 
there was a resurgence of interest in the Snake concept as it found a larger audience.<br />

#### Version 1.0
This game is implemented using Python inbuilt library [curses](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/curses.html).<br /> 
I have also used [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) library to store the high score of the game in a csv file named *italic*Scorecard.csv.<br />
